## Current Focus
- Implementing Phase 1: Router Classifier API Endpoint

## Progress Log
- Router classifier model (`router_classifier_best.keras`) added to model loading logic.
- `/predict/unified` endpoint updated to use router classifier for routing images to the correct specialized model (plant, paddy, pest).
- Endpoint now returns predictions from the routed model, along with router decision and confidence.
- Placeholder logic removed; endpoint is now functional and integrated.

## Next Steps
- Test the unified endpoint with sample images for all three classes.
- Ensure frontend integration and update documentation if needed.
